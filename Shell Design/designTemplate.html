    <p> This is just a bunch of random text to help the viewer get feel for what the webstie could look like onces it is populated. The only species, Limusaurus inextricabilis, was described in 2009 from specimens (diagram shown) found in the Upper Shishugou Formation in the Junggar Basin. Limusaurus was a small, slender animal, about 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) in length and 15 kg (33 lb) in weight, with a long neck and legs but small forelimbs. It underwent a drastic morphological transformation as it aged: while juveniles were toothed, the teeth were completely lost and replaced by a beak. This probably corresponded to a dietary shift from omnivory to herbivory.</p>
